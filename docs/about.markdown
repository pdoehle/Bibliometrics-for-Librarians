This course introduces librarians to bibliometric tools and techniques. Learners will be able to ...

- Outcome 1: Understand basics of bibliometric methodology, bibliometric indicators, and sources for bibliographic metadata and citation data for use in bibliometric analysis.
- Outcome 2: Use R packages rcrossref and citecorp to access citation metadata from the Open Citations Corpus.
- Outcome 3:  Complete a bibliometrics analysis project.


## Brief Description: 
This course will introduce students to tools and concepts for bibliometric analysis. This will begin with an introduction to bibliometric analysis, including a brief history and overview of bibliometrics; a review of bibliometric indicators and general discussion of the mathematics behind them; and direct applications for librarians. Students in this hands-on course will work directly with bibliometric data, including gathering and wrangling data using various packages in R. The course will conclude with a project bringing together these lessons. Participants will gather a body of references, calculate citation metrics, and develop visualizations based on bibliographic metadata and citation connections.

## Intended Audience: 
Librarians working in metadata, scholarly communications, systematic reviews, and reference & instruction who are seeking to improve their understanding of technologies for gathering bibliographic metadata and analyzing citations.

## Course materials: 
The instructors will use [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and [Binder repositories](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html) that will include instructions and code snippets for students to use for their assignments and notes before, during, and after class sessions. All course materials will be available at [ https://pdoehle.github.io/bibliometrics-for-librarians/](https://pdoehle.github.io/bibliometrics-for-librarians/). Students will use the [Crossref API](https://www.crossref.org/services/metadata-delivery/rest-api/) and the [OpenCitations Corpus](https://opencitations.net/) API for data sources via the R packages [citecorp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/citecorp/index.html) and [rcrossref](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rcrossref/index.html) developed by [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) . The instructors will also provide test datasets for use in exercises.

## Technical Requirements: 
The instructors will provide recorded demos for students to review. We will then hold weekly live question and answer sessions for students to ask questions and test their understanding. The instructors will also provide a platform to support asynchronous exchange, as students will be encouraged to do exercises and practice on their own.
