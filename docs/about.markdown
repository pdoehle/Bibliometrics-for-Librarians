This course introduces librarians to bibliometric tools and techniques. Learners will be able to ...

- Outcome 1: Use R to complete a range of tasks, including navigating the R Studio environment, understanding R syntax and data types, intalling and loading packages, and executing functions for tidying and analyzing data.
- Outcome 2: Understand basics of bibliometric methodology and sources for bibliometric metadata, and use R to gather and clean this data.
- Outcome 3: Create a concept map from bibliometric metadata.


## Brief Description: 
This course will introduce students to tools and concepts for bibliometric analysis. This will begin with an introduction to R, with particular focus on data cleaning & visualization. The second portion of the course will look at working with bibliometric data, including a review of bibliometric analysis, gathering data using the rcrossref and citecorp packages, and a review of confidence, centrality, and connectedness. The course will conclude with a project bringing together these lessons. Participants will gather a body of references and develop concept maps based on the available bibliometric metadata, such as titles, keywords, and abstracts.

## Intended Audience: 
Librarians working in metadata, scholarly communications, systematic reviews, and reference & instruction who are seeking to improve their understanding of technologies for extracting and analyzing bibliometric metadata.

## Course materials: 
The instructors will use [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and [Binder repositories](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html) that will include instructions and code snippets for students to use for their assignments and notes before, during, and after class sessions. All course materials will be available at [ https://pdoehle.github.io/bibliometrics-for-librarians/](https://pdoehle.github.io/bibliometrics-for-librarians/). Students will use the [Crossref API](https://www.crossref.org/services/metadata-delivery/rest-api/) and the [OpenCitations Corpus](https://opencitations.net/) API for data sources. The instructors will also provide test datasets for use in exercises.

## Technical Requirements: 
The instructors propose to provide recorded demos for students to review. We will then hold weekly live question and answer sessions for students to ask questions and test their understanding. If possible, a platform to support asynchronous exchange would be ideal, as students will be encouraged to do exercises and practice on their own.
