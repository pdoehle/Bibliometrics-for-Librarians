**Exercises & Videos**

**NOTE** It has come to my attention that as of last night (7/16), Azure Notebooks is not able to install packages and is giving a warning message that packages cannot be installed. I am looking into this and will be in touch with my findings. As an alternative, you can install Anaconda at <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/> and then download the IPYNB file from your Azure Notebook, then open it in Anaconda to run it locally. I will keep you posted.

1. Go to <https://notebooks.azure.com> and click **Sign In** to create an account. If you have an existing account with Microsoft or Outlook, you may use it.
2. While signed into your account, go to <https://notebooks.azure.com/clarke-iakovakis/projects/intro-to-bibliometrics>
3. Click the **Clone** button in the upper right corner and clone this project. This will create a duplicate of the project in your own Azure Notebooks projects
4. Click on **Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks and R.ipynb**
5. Watch the video below to use this notebook. This will introduce you to the Azure Notebooks environment and some basics of using R.
