Also, the Crossref team encourages requests with appropriate contact information, and will forward you to a dedicated API cluster for improved performance when you share your email with them. We cannot do that in this notebook, but you can do that in R.\n",

Area of research is not defined by keywords, but rather by co-citation network; that is, \"the other papers that appear alongside it in reference lists\". For more on RCR in PubMed, see [\"What is the RCR? How is the RCR score calculated?\n",
